## Set up
```{r}
rm(list=ls())
library(here)
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
bird <- read.csv(here("Data/ForgBout_00_01_07_08.csv")) 
```

## Clean up the data
Change the 06 year to 07 - we think it's a typo
Add the true/false columns 
Save as a new datafile for general use


```{r}
# add the true/false columns

bird <- bird |>
  mutate(
    Ind_Rinter = (Rinter > 0),
    Ind_Rintra = (Rintra > 0),
    Ind_Iinter = (Iinter > 0),
    Ind_Iintra = (Iintra > 0),
    Ind_Successes = (Successes > 0),
  )
```

```{r}
# change the 06 row to 07

fix <- which(bird$obsid == "060606ChrisAM")
bird$obsid[fix] <- "070606ChrisAM"

```

```{r}
# check that the row was changed - it was
which(bird$obsid == "060606ChrisAM")
```

## Save this file as a csv to use

```{r}
write.csv(bird, here("data", "ForgBout_Updated.csv"))
```
